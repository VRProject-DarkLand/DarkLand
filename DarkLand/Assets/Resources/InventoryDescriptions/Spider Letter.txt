"To the wary wanderer,

As you navigate the desolate halls of this forsaken asylum, pay close attention to your surroundings. Sometimes, salvation lies in the most unexpected places.

I have discovered something peculiar about the grand chandelier above your head, it casts a strange shadow, as if it is barely hanging on.

The chandelier is loose and looks incredibly heavy. 

If you find yourself haunted by a powerful enemy, perhaps one bound by their own dark past, remember that throwing an object at the chandelier might cause it to fall.
The impact could be catastrophic for anyone caught beneath it.

Keep this in mind as you tread carefully through these haunted corridors. The tools for survival are all around you, hidden in plain sight.

Stay vigilant and use the environment to your advantage.

Yours in hope,
An Observer in the Dark"
