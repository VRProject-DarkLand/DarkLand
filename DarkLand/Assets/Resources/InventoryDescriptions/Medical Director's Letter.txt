A Faded Note Found in the Nursery:
"To the unfortunate soul who finds this,

There is a girl here, her presence is a curse. Once she sees you, she will haunt you relentlessly. 
Her hollow eyes will follow you through every corridor, every shadow, never resting, never stopping.

But there is a way to make her stop. She is searching for something she lost a piece of her past. 
If you throw a teddy bear at her, she will stop, even if just for a while. 
It reminds her of her lost innocence, her daughter. The teddy bears are scattered around the asylum, so keep one with you at all times.

Remember:

Avoid Her Gaze: If she doesn't see you, she won't start the hunt. Stay out of sight and move quietly, crouching can help you.
Keep a Teddy Bear: If she starts chasing you, throw a teddy bear at her to stop her. It's the only thing that can calm her down.
Stay vigilant and tread carefully. Survive her, and you might find a way out of this nightmare.

There are some items that may help you survive, there is Adrenaline for restoring health and an axe to attack mortal enemies.
Some doors are locked, but I now that the keys to open them are also scattered in the asylum, go find them.

P.S. 
Sign the book at the asylum entrance to not lose your progress.

With hope,
A Desperate Survivor"
