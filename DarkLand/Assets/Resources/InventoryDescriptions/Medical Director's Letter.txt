A Faded Note Found in the Nursery:
"To the unfortunate soul who finds this,

There is a girl here, her presence is a curse. Once she sees you, she will haunt you relentlessly. 
Her hollow eyes will follow you through every corridor, every shadow, never resting, never stopping.

But there is a way to make her stop. She is searching for something she lost a piece of her past. 
If you throw a teddy bear at her, she will stop, even if just for a while. 
It reminds her of her lost innocence, her daughter. The teddy bears are scattered around the asylum, so keep one with you at all times.

Remember:

Avoid Her Gaze: If she doesn't see you, she won't start the hunt. Stay out of sight and move quietly.
Keep a Teddy Bear: If she starts chasing you, throw a teddy bear at her to stop her. It's the only thing that can calm her down.
Stay vigilant and tread carefully. Survive her, and you might find a way out of this nightmare.

With hope,
A Desperate Survivor"
