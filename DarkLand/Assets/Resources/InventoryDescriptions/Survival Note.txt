"To whoever finds this,

Beware the child with the empty eyes. She likes to play a game, a twisted version of hide and seek. If she sees you, the game begins, and you must hide. Remember, she counts to ten, and then she hunts.

I've learned a few things that might help you:

Stay Out of Sight: If she doesn't see you, she can't start the game. Move quietly and avoid brightly lit areas.
Hiding Spots: The lockers are your safest bet. If she starts counting, find a locker quickly and hide inside. She rarely checks them.
Act Fast: If you don't hide within ten seconds, she will freeze you in place and haunt you.
Survive her game, and you might just live to see another day.

Good luck,
A Fellow Survivor"
